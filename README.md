# notepad--
An ultra-lightweight text editor for windows.

To use, open the command console, navigate to the directory with `notepad--.bat` and type `notepad--.bat [FILENAME]`. If the file does not exist it will be created.

To edit, type the line number and it will be displayed, then you need to retype the entire line.

To add new lines, type the desired line number and that many lines will be added. Removing lines is not supported.
